# yesod-katip - Use Katip in your Yesod site

`yesod-katip` is a utility library for easily adding [`katip`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/katip) operability to your [`yesod`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yesod) site. It provides class instances for logging to Katip scribes directly from a Yesod `HandlerFor`; as well as utility wrappers for augmenting a Yesod site with useful Katip behaviours, like pulling in HTTP context automatically, and making the Yesod logger output to Katip.

For more information, have a look at the module documentation.
